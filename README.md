# the_concepts

This project is about concept mining from course material. The goal of this project is to extract concepts from the lecture slide (Microsoft PowerPoint), determine the relations among those concepts and how important those concepts are, and finally come up with UI that students can use. The student can use it to enhance their learning experience and review the course material. The prototype can be accessed on https://theconcepts.updog.co/home.html.
